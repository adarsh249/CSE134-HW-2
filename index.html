                My name is Adarsh Patel and I am a computer science major at the University of
                California, San Diego graduating in June 2024. I am currently looking for new
                graduate openings in any web development or computer graphics roles!

                <h3>Analytics Dashboard | <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>PHP</em>, <em>MySQL</em></h3>
                <p>
                    This is the first project on my resume, as it is one of my most comprehensive projects. In this project, we created a web server using <strong>Apache</strong> 
                    and <strong>Digital Ocean</strong> to track data about users who enter our site. Any user who entered our site was given a session ID, or cookie, and we simply tracked
                    their static, performance, and activity data. This was including, but not limited to, how long the page took to load, what kind of device they are on, the dimensions of the screen
                    of the device, exactly where their cursor was on our site and what keys they pressed, how long they were idle for, if they were idle, and when they returned. We then created
                    our own <strong>RESTful API</strong> using <strong>Node.js</strong> and injected this data into our <strong>MySQL</strong> database. After this part was done, we created a dashboard for verified users to 
                    visualize this data. We implemented an authentication system using <strong>JWT</strong> and created normal users and admin users. Normal users were allowed to checkout the dashboard we
                    created and generate a two-page report about the dashboard. Admin users could do this as well, but in addition, had an user management tab that would bring up an user management
                    table, where they could add, delete, and update users. This is essentially a <strong>CRUD</strong> grid. We used <strong>PHP</strong> to extract data from the database and create both the user management
                    table and the dashboard. The dashboard was creating using the <strong>ZingChart</strong> library. The management table was created using the <strong>ZingGrid</strong> library. We used <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> to
                    build and style the page properly. Unfortunately, there is no GitHub associated with this project and the link no longer works since we shut down the server as it became too expensive to run for
                    us college students. However, the code is available upon request.

                    This was a project created by a group of 10 members, where I was a team-lead, and the main goal was to both build something from scatch and follow the <strong>Agile</strong> process. I led a team of 
                    9 other developers to build this web application using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. We followed the <strong>Agile</strong> process meaning, in week 2, we started off with team
                    bonding exercises. Then in week 3, we began <strong>brainstorming</strong> using Miro board. In week 4, we created <strong>user personas/stories</strong>, to create a user-centered application. Then,
                    in week 5, a prototype design on <strong>Figma</strong> was created, meaning we had numerous <strong>svg</strong> options and also <strong>wireframes</strong> to help us guide ourselves. Then, from weeks 6 to 9,
                    the focus was on simply coding. I held weekly <strong>sprints</strong>. This obviously called for weekly <strong>sprint review meetings</strong> and <strong>retrospective meetings</strong>. In week 10, we concluded
                    the project by creating robust testing through <strong>Jest/Puppeteer</strong>. This whole project was mostly collaborated through <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>Discord</strong>, and <strong>GitHub</strong>. Check out the GitHub 
                    link which will have both our administrative and technical repositories.

                <aside>
                    In this project, we also had to report to our boss, the TA. In addition, the professor, our boss's boss, had constraints and requirements
                    we had to adhere to throughout the development of this project.

                <p>
                    In the admin repository, you can find anything <strong>Agile</strong> related including <strong>meeting notes</strong>, 
                    <strong>Architectural Decision Records</strong> and the practices mentioned earlier. Throughout this period, we also created a robust <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipeline. Those documents can also be found in the <strong>GitHub</strong>. This pipeline
                    included a <strong>linter</strong>, the <strong>Code Climate</strong> quality checker, a manual <strong>pull request</strong> review, automated testing through <strong>Puppeteer</strong> and <strong>Jest</strong> as well as a <strong>JSDocs</strong> deployment.
